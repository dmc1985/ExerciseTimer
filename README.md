# :muscle: ExerciseTimer :watch:

> A simple, function React Native application for doing with timed exercises without having to worry about a stopwatch
 
Between having a young child and working an office job, I have had my fair share of back problems. In spite of the theatrics, I have found this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydT74SAts7M&list=PLVhCKQfUJK_0N9mxzd5Vql5tmzCTlp6w2&index=3&t=274s to be extremely useful. The only problem is that it involves four timed exercises that are impossible to do correctly while holding a stopwatch. That is the inspiration behind this application.    

## :star: Features

- Simple form to create routines composed of exercises with a customizable rep length, break length, and time before the next one
- Routines are modifiable after they have been created
- The app tells you when to to take a break, start a new rep, start a new exercise, and when the routine is finished
- Possible to cycle through exercises, reset a given exercise or the whole routine
- Customizable countdown time to begin each routine
- The app remains visible and audible without requiring any adjustment to the phone's settings
